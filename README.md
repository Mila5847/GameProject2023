# GameProject2023

## Project Overview
Done throughout my second year of College in Computer Science in my Game Development with the Unity Cross-Platform Game Engine class, the
game project is developed by a team of four members and the help of our teacher. The project consists of three minigames involving a character trying to catch a dragon. 
Each minigame must be completed with a certain amount of stars so the user (controlling the character) can go to the next level.

## Project Description 
The story follows a brave young hero, Alex who ventures into long abandoned ancient ruins to track down what appears to be a ferocious dragon. Through a series of trials, our young paladin gets closer and closer to catching the dragon. Through trials and tribulations, our hero and the dragon soon realize that they aren't as different as everyone makes them out to be. 
The game consists of three levels, each having three minigames, each with the goal of getting Alex closer to the dragon. The first of the minigames aims to trap the dragon. The game consists of placing tiles in a smart
way to corner the dragon. The second minigame consists of tactically maneuvering a piece of meat to the dragon to gain its trust. 
Finally, the third minigame consists of a memory game, which compares Alexâ€™s belongings to the belongings of the dragon.
Stars are granted to the player depending on how well they completed each minigame.

### Set Up

#### Platform used
The Unity platform provides a "Scene" view which allows you to visually construct and edit your scenes. You can add and position objects,
adjust their properties, set up lighting and cameras, and define the overall layout and composition of your game world. The platform also
provides the active scene that is currently being played or simulated in the Unity editor or during the actual gameplay. 
When you press the "Play" button in the Unity editor, the Game scene is created, and your game starts running in the game window or on 
the target platform.
